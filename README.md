## Yxney project

I've registered yxney.net a few years ago. It is a nice name for the outermost tip of a peninsula close to 
where I was growing up, in Sandefjord, Norway. Yes, it is a strange name.

Now I use the name as a project name also.

I will use this repository to upload source code for packages that I use in private projects.

This is still in its infancy, but I learn as I go.
